### 🐍 About the Project
  - The Snake Game is a browser-based recreation of the classic arcade game, designed to practice advanced React concepts after learning the fundamentals. The game focuses on real-time updates, collision detection, and smooth user interactions within a component-driven architecture.
  - This project demonstrates effective handling of game loops, user input, and dynamic rendering in a React environment.

### ✨ Features
  - Classic snake movement mechanics with continuous gameplay
  - Keyboard arrow controls for intuitive direction changes
  - On-screen control buttons for play, pause, and direction handling
  - Accurate collision detection when the snake hits:
